## Generalist
- Focus on functional and logical improvements; avoid cosmetic reformatting.
- Defer style enforcement to Prettier (see `.prettierrc`).
- Do not alter indentation or line wrapping unless necessary for clarity.
- Add concise comments where the code’s intent isn’t immediately obvious.
- If the project’s file layout changes or new files are added, update `/docs/folder-structure.md` to reflect the new structure.
